	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>My name is Ruheen Vahora. I am 19 years old. I was born in Bridgeport CT, however I was raised in South Carolina for most of my life. I am the youngest of three daughters in my family. I currently go to UofSC as a sophomore majoring in Biological Sciences and minoring in Neuroscience.<span id="continue"></span><span id="hidden"><BR><BR>My favorite color is blue. My parents are originally from India. I speak multiple languages like English, Hindi and Gujrati. I love travelling and experiencing new things. I love dogs especially German shepards. </span></p>

	<h2>My Future Career Plans</h2>
	<p>At first I wanted to be a dentist, so when I came to UofSC I was on the pre-dental track. However, now I am on the pre-PA track. I really wanted to get involved in healthcare and I felt like PA would be more suitable for me. I really love seeing the work PAs do and it made me want to try it out.<span id="continued"></span><span id="hide"><BR><BR> I hope to graduate early in December of  2024. I want to take a gap year to get used to working at the hospitals and also getting a lot more experience. I will hopefully apply to PA school and get in my first cycle. However if it doesn't work out, I plan on getting a masters in health administration.</span></p>
